      "about": "A bonafide superstar of the sport and the TATA IPL, Virat Kohli has been with the Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) through thick and thin. The flamboyant cricketer was the captain of the Indian team that won the 2008 ICC U-19 Cricket World Cup and since then there has been no looking back for Kohli. He made his IPL debut shortly after that U-19 win and has been part of the RCB set-up ever since, also leading the side from 2013 to 2021, during which he guided them to the 2016 final. That same year, he scored a record 973 runs, which is still the most runs scored in a single IPL edition. The former India captain, who is the only player with over 8000 IPL runs, has also scaled incredible heights in international cricket. He was retained by RCB for IPL 2025 and goes into the tournament on the back of another Orange Cap-winning 2024 season.",

The right-handed batter, who represents Madhya Pradesh in domestic cricket, has continued to impress in the IPL and in domestic cricket since then with his highly consistent performances and has even represented India in Tests and ODIs. After leading Madhya Pradesh to the final of the Syed Mushtaq Ali T20 Trophy title in 2024, Patidar has now been given the responsibility of guiding RCB to their maiden TATA IPL title.",

Salt’s first stint in the TATA IPL came in the 2023 season, when he represented Delhi Capitals and impressed in the games that he played. But it was in the 2024 season, after coming into the Kolkata Knight Riders side as a replacement for compatriot Jason Roy, that Salt took the IPL by storm by playing a huge role in KKR’s title victory with 435 runs in 12 games at an average of almost 40 and a fantastic strike-rate of 182. Salt, who was part of England’s 2022 T20 World Cup winning campaign, is now a crucial member of the limited-overs set up. He was acquired by RCB for a whopping INR 11.5 Crore ahead of TATA IPL 2025.",

With his ability to play effective cameos, finish games, and keep wickets as well, Sharma is an excellent utility player. RCB shelling out a whopping INR 11 Crore for Sharma ahead of TATA IPL 2025 showcases his promise.",

Over the years, Mayank has turned out for Delhi Capitals (DC), Rising Pune Supergiant (RPS), Punjab Kings (PBKS), where he also served as captain, and Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH). Beyond the IPL, he has had an impactful career in the Indian jersey, especially in Test cricket, where he famously broke Don Bradman’s record to become the second-fastest player to score two double hundreds, achieving the feat in just 12 innings. His domestic form heading into TATA IPL 2025 has been stellar. Leading Karnataka in the Vijay Hazare Trophy 2024–25, Mayank racked up 651 runs in 10 games, including four centuries and a half-century, steering his team to the title.",

With the ability to trouble batters courtesy of a slingy action, Thushara was acquired by Mumbai Indians (MI) for INR 4.8 Crore ahead of TATA IPL 2024 and was among the wickets more often than not in the games that he played. Now in the Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) set-up after being bought by them ahead of IPL 2025, Thushara is part of a star-studded fast-bowling line-up alongside the likes of Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Josh Hazlewood, and Lungisani Ngidi.",

He won the player-of-the-match award on his international debut in 2017, playing a T20I against Sri Lanka. Since then, Ngidi has been a regular feature of South Africa’s sides across formats, and is one of the few bowlers to boast a bowling average below 30 in all three formats of the game at the international level. The Durban-native picked 11 wickets in seven games at an average of 14.18 during CSK’s 2018 title-winning campaign. Now much more experienced, Ngidi was acquired by RCB for TATA IPL 2025 at his base price of INR 1 Crore.",

Playing for Gujarat Titans, he made his TATA IPL debut in 2022 and a strong showing that saw him claiming 11 wickets in nine games played a crucial role in GT’s title victory. After another year with GT, he moved to the Royal Challengers Bengaluru in 2024. Another good season saw him picking up 15 wickets, one of them being the wicket of MS Dhoni in a thrilling finish at the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium, thus helping RCB win that game en route to making it to the playoffs. One of only three players retained by RCB ahead of the 2025 Mega Auction, there are huge expectations from Dayal in RCB’s quest for a maiden title.",

Livingstone announced his arrival in the T20I arena with the fastest hundred (off 42 balls) for England in just his sixth match, against Pakistan in Nottingham. While his initial IPL stints were with RR in 2019 and 2021, he was one of PBKS’ biggest signings – INR 11.50 Cr – during the TATA IPL 2022 auction. And he lived up to expectations, smashing 437 runs from 14 matches at an average of 36.42 and a staggering strike rate of 182.08. Part of England’s 2022 T20 World Cup-winning side, Livingstone is also quite capable with his part-time leg-spin, and his all-round abilities saw RCB spending INR 8.75 Crore on him in the Mega Auction ahead of TATA IPL 2025.",

David has been a regular feature in the Australian T20I set-up over the past few years.

Bhandage is a powerful left-handed batter who can play as a finisher and bowls right-arm medium pace, thus bringing great variety to the teams he plays for. Bought back by RCB in the TATA IPL 2025 Mega Auction to be part of a side that has some world-class all-rounders, Bhandage will aim to add to his skill set by learning from some of the best.",
